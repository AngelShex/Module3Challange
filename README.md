#### License 

I have used refrenses from two YouTube videos for this challange. The first video was made by Great Stack team the URL of this video is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBcqGxrr9g8.

Second referense was from CodingSkillsBootcamp University of Riverside sites and materials. There base project requirments came from their ReadMe file repo. 

Have also used some intruction from a coding bootcamp tutor session with Juan Delgado. He helped me have some better understanding of the code input for highscore and countdown timer application. 

Fianl material help was from the current instructor of this bootcamp session Dani Chankhour for more understanding of paring the style sheet of the code.
